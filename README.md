- 👋 Hi, I’m @reaial I am a senior at the University of Pittsburgh, I am a video game design major, with a concentration in film. 
- 👀 I’m interested in all types of programming languaes, music, film, and art. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, and hope to learn C# soon in order to game develop in Unity.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that has to deal with webdevelopment, and anything that would help me learn C# or even python. I am interested in anything that deals with technology, and I am open to learning all languages and all sides of tech.  
- 📫 How to reach me rlf59@pitt.edu. 

I would say that my strong suit is front end development so if there is any means to collaborate with this side of anything I would love the oppurtunity to collaborate with you!
