- 👋 Hi, I’m @reaial I am a post production trainee in the United Kingdom orking on making fake sites for short films  
- 👀 I’m interested in all types of music, film, and just learning python for the fun of it. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, and working with an Indie Game Dev Compay as the game writer. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to find anyone who can make better fake sites than I can in order to help projects that require such development. 


I would say that my strong suit is front end development so if there is any means to collaborate with this side of anything I would love the oppurtunity to collaborate with you!
